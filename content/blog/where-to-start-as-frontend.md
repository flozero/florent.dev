## "What advice would you give me as a Front End Developer?"

I still struggle with answering that simple question even after 7 years of experience as a Front End developer,

Recently, I've become entangled in the realm of software architecture and it's helped me see "the big picture" of the last 7 years of my career.

In the early days of my career, a subtle frustration was growing inside of me about the number of new frameworks that were being released.
I'm talking about Angular 1, React, and Jquery. Each time a new framework was released, I began to rethink my entire life and try to learn it as fast as I could.

I quickly realized it wasn't sustainable, nor efficient. I needed a different way of thinking.

Instead of mastering each framework, I decided to take a step back and dissect what frameworks really are...

## The key concepts of a framework are the following:

1. Rendering DOM elements.
2. Using a virtual DOM.
3. Creating and rendering state.
4. Routing.
5. Component Rendering.

And... that is simply it. Those 5 concepts make up what frameworks are today. If you understand how those concepts work, you will become framework agnostic - which in my opinion is the most important quality to have as a developer. You are more than the framework you've mastered.

When managers ask me to write a test for front-end developerâ€™s technical interviews, I always go with a full vanilla JavaScripttest in order to tackle those concepts.

Mastering those 5 topics will propel your career as a junior developer and it's exactly the advice I wish I received when I started.

I hope this helps you, I encourage you to take a step back and look at the concepts that shaped you into the developer you are today.

PS: If you're interested in seeing some basic code examples of these concepts feel free to ping me on Linkedin and I can post a github project of it.
